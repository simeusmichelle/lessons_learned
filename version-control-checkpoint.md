2. Where can you find additional information about the Git commands available?

3. Why are branches useful?
⋅⋅* Branches are useful because they allow you to take a section of code to work on without directly changing the master. Branches add for collaboration without direct editing.

4. What is the purpose of a remote?
⋅⋅* The purpose of a remote is to have access to a file your team is collaborating on in order to clone it locally. Remotes allow you to push changes on to them so other people can see them. A remote is like a bookmark.

5. Why is it important to track changes to the upstream repository after you create your initial fork?
⋅⋅* It is important so you're aware of any changes that occur on your local master. Upstreaming allows you to stay updated on the project and keeps your branch updated.
