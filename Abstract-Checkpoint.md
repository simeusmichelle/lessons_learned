# An Abstract Look at Problem Solving Checkpoint

1.What are the steps involved in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

Gather your tools which include a knife, your choice of peanut butter, your choice of jelly, a napkin, and two pieces of bread.
Next, you’ll lay out the two pieces of bread, take your knife and dip it into the peanut butter.
Take the peanut butter from your knife and spread it evenly onto one of the pieces of bread.
After spreading out the peanut butter, take your napkin, and wipe the peanut butter residue from your knife.
Then, take the knife and dip it into your jelly. Take the jelly covered knife and spread it evenly onto your second piece of bread.
Once both pieces of bread are covered, place them together to make your sandwich.

2. In our “Say Hi” example, if the __Say Hi__ part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the cause of the problem? Explain the process and use a roadmap to visualize it.
The process used in the roadmap includes:
USER NAME INPUT---->USER BUTTON CLICK----->SAY HI

The way I would narrow down the problem includes working backwards. I’d go through the code for the “Say Hi” output and see if it is typed in properly. Next, I would look at the “User Button Click” and go through the code for that to figure out why the “Say Hi” output is not showing. If everything seems fine in the “User Button Click,” I will then proceed to analyze the code for the “User Name Input.”

3. Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.

“How to right foot plow stop in roller derby”
Stay balanced while moving forward on your roller skates----> shift your weight to your left leg-------> squat down while looking forward-------> press your weight into the ground and drag your right foot into your left------->come to a complete stop

As a roller derby athlete, “plow stops” are a very important skill to have  in order to keep opponents from passing me to score points. This is a skill everyone needs to do effectively, in order to create a barrier for the opposing team. One big problem, with plow stops is the inability for some, to come to a complete stop without falling over and staying centered. When I don’t plow stop effectively, I go backwards and figure out what I did wrong in that instance. Most times, I’m not “pressing my weight into the ground.” When I fix that problem, my stops become effective.
